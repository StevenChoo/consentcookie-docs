## ConsentCookie on your website

Download the script [here](https://cdn.humanswitch.services/cc/consentcookie/consentcookie.min.js) or [build your own \(custom\) ConsentCookie](./#build-your-own-consentcookie)

Include the script on your website:

```markup
<script src="/path/to/consentcookie.min.js"></script>
```

Initialize ConsentCookie:

```markup
<script>
// An example of ConsentCookie initialized with a custom config
ConsentCookie.init({
    'connections': {
      'cc': {
        'initstate': 'disabled'
      },
      'iq': {
        'initstate': 'optout'
      },
      'ga': {
        'initstate': 'disabled'
      },
      'gtm': {
        'initstate': 'disabled'
      }
    },
    'moreinfolink': 'https://www.humanswitch.io/over/privacy/'
  });
</script>
```

To load a tracker based on the ConsentCookie preference of the user you can do the following:

```markup
<script>
// Check if the user accepted the consent for the given connection by its id
if(ConsentCookie.get("id").flag === 1){
  // Do stuff
}
</script>
```

### Google Analytics example

```markup
<script>
// Check if the user accepted the Google Analytics consent
if(ConsentCookie.get("ga").flag === 1){
  // If so, load the Google Analytics integration script, https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/

  // The script provided by Google Anayltics
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

  ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');
  ga('send', 'pageview');

}
</script>
```

## Basic Usage

### API

| Method | Params | Description | Docs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ConsentCookie.init` | `config` | Initialize ConsentCookie with the given config | [link](./#consentcookieinit) |
| `ConsentCookie.on` | `event, callback` | Listen for the event with the given callback | [link](./#consentcookieon) |
| `ConsentCookie.off` | `event, callback` | Remove event listener\(s\) for the given event | [link](./#consentcookieoff) |
| `ConsentCookie.get` | `id` | Get the consent for the given id | [link](./#consentcookieget) |
| `ConsentCookie.registerPlugin` | `plugin` | Register a ConsentCookie plugin | [link](./#consentcookieregisterplugin) |

**ConsentCookie.init**

To enabled ConsentCookie you need to initialize it with a config object. The config object should have the following properties:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `moreinfolink` | The link that is shown on the bottom of the connections view |
| `connections` | The connections that ConsentCookie manages given as an object where each property key is the id of the connection and the property value the config of the connection |

```javascript
ConsentCookie.init({
    'connections': {
      // connection 1
      'id 2':{
        //connection config
      }
      // connection 2
      'id 1':{
        //connection config
      }
    },
    'moreinfolink': 'https://www.link-to-your-info.com'
  });
</script>
```

A connection represents a consent integration with your website. Each connection has a specific id that should correspond with an id of a connection listed in [ConsentCookie tracker list](https://github.com/StevenChoo/consentcookie/tree/6e895a67cdc6f48e30b212b69f454a497fd82bd7/src/assets/json/trackers.json). The connection config should have the following properties

| Name | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| initstate | optin, optout, disabled |  |

#### ConsentCookie.on

You can listen for an event with a given callback:

```javascript
ConsentCookie.on("consent",function($payload){
  // Do stuff
});
```

The following events are emitted:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `consent` | All events related to consent changes |
| `profile` | All events related to changes of a consent profile |

The callback function will receive a single payload object as argument with the following default properties:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | The id of the consent connection |
| `state` | The update state related to the event |

Depending on the event type additional properties can be available in the payload object.

#### ConsentCookie.off

You can remove all event listeners of an event by giving the name of the specific event:

```javascript
ConsentCookie.off("consent");
```

You can also remove a single listener:

```javascript
var specificListener = function($payload){
  // Do stuff
};

// Register the specific listener
ConsentCookie.on("consent",specificListener);

// Unregister the specific listener
ConsentCookie.off("consent",specificListener);
```

#### ConsentCookie.get

You can get the current state of a consent by giving the id of the consent:

```javascript
ConsentCookie.get("id");
```

The return is a consent object with the following properties:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | The id of the consent connection |
| `flag` | The flag related to the state of the consent. 0=disabled 1=enabled |

#### ConsentCookie.registerPlugin

To add addition functionality to ConsentCookie, you can register a plugin for each unique connection.

### Plugins

ConsentCookie plugins provide the option to extend ConsentCookie functionality for specific connections. Each connection can load a \(custom\) plugin. Default plugins are provided by the default ConsentCookie tracker list.

Plugins are Javascript files following a spefic convention and should be publicly availbled by a url. They are initially loaded when opening the Connections view, for each connection if configured for that specific connection.

**Example**

```javascript
(function ($global) {

function Plugin() {}

Plugin.prototype.register = function ($context) {
this.context = $context;
};

Plugin.prototype.getId = function () {};

Plugin.prototype.getProfileId = function () {};

Plugin.prototype.getProfileIds = function () {};

Plugin.prototype.getProfile = function () {};

Plugin.prototype.getProfileInfo = function () {};

Plugin.prototype.deleteProfile = function () {};

if (!$global || !$global.ConsentCookie || typeof $global.ConsentCookie.registerPlugin !== 'function') {
throw new Error('ConsentCookie not available. Unable to register plugin: ' + DEFAULT_ID);
}

$global.ConsentCookie.registerPlugin(new Plugin());

})(window);
```

#### Registering a plugin in the ConsentCookie client

To make the plugin available in ConsentCookie it needs to register itself by calling `ConsentCookie.registerPlugin`. Calling this function, will load the plugin and call `Plugin.register` providing a context object that can be used within the plugin.

```javascript
$global.ConsentCookie.registerPlugin(new Plugin());
```

Called by ConsentCookie when registerPlugin is executed:

```javascript
Plugin.prototype.register = function ($context) {
  this.context = $context;
};
```

**Plugin Context**

The plugin context is a Javascript object with the following API:

| Method | Params | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| getLib | $name | Returns the available library by its name | context.getLib\("http"\) |

The following libraries are available:

| Name | Description | API info |
| --- | --- | --- |
| http | library for making http requests within the plugin. Currently vue-resources is referenced. | [https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource](https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource) |
| cookie | library for handling browser cookies. Currently js-cookie is referenced | [https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) |
| \_ | library for different Javascript helpers. Currently underscore is referenced | [http://underscorejs.org/](http://underscorejs.org/) |

**Plugin default interface**

ConsentCookie will call the following functions of the plugin when implemented.

| Method | Description | Return type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| getId | Should return the id of the connection of the plugin | String |
| getProfileId | Should return the id of the profile the connection manages | String |
| getProfileIds | Should return an array of all profile id\`s the connection manages | Array |
| getProfile | Should return the profile managed by the connection as a Javascript object | Promise |
| getProfileInfo | Should return an object that represents the profile and is shown within ConsentCookie | Promise |
| deleteProfile | Should delete the profile managed by the connection | Promise |

**Plugin.getProfileInfo**

This function is used by ConsentCookie to show a summary of the profile the connection is managing. ConsentCookie uses a default template for showing this info. The template consists of a header and content panel.

When ConsentCookie calls getProfileInfo it expects a promise that resolves in an object with the following properties:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `header` | a String with valid HTML that is shown as the header |
| `content` | a String with valid HTML that is shown as content |

```javascript
{
    "header": "<div>I am a header</div>",
    "content": "<div>I am content</div>"
}
```

**Plugin listening for events**

A plugin can also listen for changes by using the ConsentCookie event framework.

```javascript
// Plugin code that runs when loading the plugin
(function ($global) {

    // Register event listener when plugin is loaded
    $global.ConsentCookie.on('connection', function ($payload) {

        // Listen for connection changes

        // Do stuff
    });

})(window);
```

**Custom plugin**

By default all used plugins are defined in the [ConsentCookie tracker list](https://github.com/StevenChoo/consentcookie/tree/6e895a67cdc6f48e30b212b69f454a497fd82bd7/src/assets/json/trackers.json). When you want to use a custom plugin for a specific connection your can override the default url with a custom one.

To override the default url, add the property `plugin` to the connection config of which you want to load the custom plugin.

```javascript
ConsentCookie.init({
    'connections': {
      // Google Analytics with custom plugin
      'ga': {
        'initstate': 'disabled',
        'plugin':'https://yourdomain.com/the/location/of/the/plugin.js'
      }
    },
    'moreinfolink': 'https://www.link-to-your-info.com'
  });
```
