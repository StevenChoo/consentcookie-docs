# Google Analytics Anonymization

Google Analytics has the [option](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/ip-anonymization) to collect data of your website visitors anonymously. ConsentCookie provides the option to conditionally enable this option based on the consent setting of Google Analytics.

For example, Google Analytics is configured as [opt-in](../configuration/) but you still want to collect data anonymously when the website visitor has not yet given their consent for analytic purposes.

The default Google Analytics site tag script looks as follow
